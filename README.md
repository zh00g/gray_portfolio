i've been meaning to create a site from scratch for myself for years -- this is me finally following through. this is built with Nextjs and Tailwind and deployed on Vercel. (much thanks to alix for introducing me to all of the above). 

If you would like to use any of the designs or code i've made and written, please let me know! :)
