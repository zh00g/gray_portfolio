                        music is the single most defining part of my life. i take a truly abhorrent amount of pride in how many spotify minutes i rack up every year, and my playlists are a journal in and of themselves. there&apos;s a story in every playlist i make, and i&apos;d say i have pretty wide ranging and esoteric tastes. here&apos;s my attempt to chart some of the most notable memories or stories throughout the years.

                        â€¢ i first started listening to edm when i heard scary monsters and nice sprites back in 2012. i&apos;d been doing golf camp with my friends howard and toya, and the song came on while we were all gaming at howard&apos;s place afterwards. from there, i found my way to monstercat, which was my edm haven for years and still is the source of so much nostalgia. songs like flight tristam + braken, and surface aero chord, and snake eyes feint were the soundtrack of my summer library studying. from there i made my way to mr.suicidesheep and ncs and proximity and eventually stumbled upon old dubstep from people like illenium, which was the melodic dubstep rabbithole. i love all edm and have gotten to see so many artists, but there&apos;s so many more that i want to see! definitely a headbanging-on-the-rails person. my one claim to fame is a 2 second clip of me on the rails at kaivon&apos;s set at audio summer 2022 that made it into one of his promo vids. some artists i&apos;d love to see are excision, kai wachi, and hex cougar.

                        â€¢ i grew up listening to classic rock on the radio, interspersed with npr and the local sports station. some of the most nostalgic songs i have are 70s and 80s rock, and they always reminds me of being a kid again in the backseat of our &apos;01 civic. my parents both have a lot of old favorites too, surprisingly, and a good amount of old chinese rock features pretty heavily as well. from red hot chilli peppers to fleet macwood and everything in between, i always go back to the oldies when i&apos;m feeling a little nostalgic and thinking about home.
